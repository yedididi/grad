TCP SYN-FLOOD ATTACKING CODE
============================

* This project aims to create SYN packets with random source-IP numbers.
* SYN packets are the first steps of a TCP-3-way handshake and by doing a SYN-flood attack, one can exhaust a server's sources and can block its data transmission. 
* Our code takes IP address and port number of the destination server which will be attacked. You can save your interface name on a .conf file for further developments. 
* Finally, after attack, created random IP addresses will be stored in a text file for further examination.

GETTING STARTED
---------------

* Download this c file from https://github.com/boranyldrm/Kangal. After compilation and running, you are supposed to enter interface name you are sending data through. (You can check yours via ipconfig (Windows users), ifconfig (Linux users), etc.)
* After that, enter IPv4 address you want to practice SYN-flood attack. (_Do not forget to conform standard IPv4 syntax: x.x.x.x_)
* Enter destination port number. 
* Hitting ENTER, attack begins...

RUNNING THE TESTS
-----------------

* Be careful about the server's to which you attacked firewall subnetting protocols. For this code, we kept 10.20.50.0/24 as our subnet because our server was programmed to accept from only these IP addresses. You can edit/add more octets to your random IPs.
* You can trace your SYN packets by tcpdump (Linux) or Wireshark.
* Also you can specify SYN packets' quantity, duration through which they are sent. You only need to comment out necessary lines.

EXTRA PROJECT
-------------

* Now, Vlan Double Tagging is available. You can create an ICMP packet with double tags to spoof trunk ports to forward your packets through different vlans. You only need to specify source and destination MAC and IP addresses and VLAN ID numbers.

* TO RUN SYN-FLOOD ATTACK, TYPE MAKE SYN / MAKE SYNRUN. 
* TO RUN DOUBLE TAGGING, TYPE MAKE VLAN / MAKE VLANRUN.
